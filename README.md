this was solely for experimental and educational purposes by a 1st year STI cs student

**System flow**
The system compared input and output data after the unsuccessful login
attempt, necessitating input and output measurements to provide
processed output.

The login screen, where users are prompted to input their account number
and pin code, is where the system begins. The number of attempts is then
controlled by the system, in situations where the user's input was incorrect.
The system would then compare and certify the process once the inputs
were equal. Moving on to the following section. The landing page, the user
would be prompted to select a transaction on the landing page. whether it's
a withdrawal or a deposit. Following the selection of a transaction, the
system would once more ask the user to input a deposit or withdrawal
amount before asking if they wanted to finalize the transaction. Until it was
decided to log out, the user would remain logged in.
